"Deleted" code from SCNA Code Retreat With Tom Kowal <a href="https://github.com/tk-kowal">__@tk-kowal__</a>

If you are worried I'm doing this wrong by showing this, do not dispair. This is not the work of the code retreat. That only was an hour upon the stage and was heard no more. These are only the footprints left from dancing in the sand.

Paired with <a href="https://github.com/cctang">__@cctang__</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bmatto">__@bmatto__</a>
among others whose names have been swept from my mind like the inevitable oblivion that will sweep my footprints from the shores of the universe.
